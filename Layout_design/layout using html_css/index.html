                 <h4>Coding Improves Problem Solving Skills ?</h4><br>

                  <p>Coding teaches you how to think. During the coding process, you need to give a solution to an issue that involves intensive problem-solving skills.
                    It trains your brain to think deeply, identify the troubles, and break things up,
                    then put the pieces together with a solution. These kinds of troubleshooting skills help 
                    you become a smarter person personally and professionally and see a situation from a
                    completely new perspective.</p> <br>

                   <h4>Coding Develops Logical Thinking ?</h4><br>

                   <p>Coding encourages you to use logic and algorithms to create a program. When facing a new challenge,
                    you need to follow a logical approach to solve the issue. 
                    Therefore, this is an exercise for your brain to train up your logical ability.
                    Logical thinking is not only about solving algorithms but also beneficial to your personal and professional life.</p>
